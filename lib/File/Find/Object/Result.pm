=head1 NAME

File::Find::Object::Result - a result class for File::Find::Object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class returning a single L<File::Find::Object> result as returned
by its next_obj() method.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 File::Find::Object::Result->new({%args});

Initializes a new object from %args. For internal use.

=head2 $result->base()

Returns the base directory from which searching began.

=head2 $result->path()

Returns the full path of the result. As such C<< $ffo->next_obj()->path() >>
is equivalent to C<< $ffo->next() >> .

=head2 $result->is_dir()

Returns true if the result refers to a directory.

=head2 $result->is_file()

Returns true if the result refers to a plain file (equivalent to the Perl
C<-f> operator).

=head2 $result->is_link()

Returns true if the result is a symbolic link.

=head2 $result->dir_components()

The components of the directory part of the path starting from base()
(also the full path if the result is a directory) as an array reference.

=head2 $result->basename()

Returns the basename of the file (if it is a file and not a directory.)
Otherwise - undef().

=head2 $result->full_components()

Returns the full components of the result with the basename if it is
a file.

Returns a single array reference.

=head2 $result->stat_ret()

The return value of L<perlfunc/stat> for the result, placed
inside an array reference. This is calculated by L<File::Find::Object> and
kept here for convenience and for internal use.
